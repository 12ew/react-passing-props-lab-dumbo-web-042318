# React Passing Props Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice passing props around
2. Practice moving state to the edge of the application

## Overview

This lab might be conceptually difficult â€” we want to take everything that
students have learned about handling props and state and use it to help push
state to the top of some component hierarchy, and then just to let props trickle
down.
